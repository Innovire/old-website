                      <p> Thank you to everyone who came out to our 5th annual Innovire Summit on Saturday, May 27th! 
                        It was an amazing success, and our team was incredibly thrilled to have celebrated our 5th year 
                        anniversary with you all. We had over 220 attendees from all over the GTA, 3 keynote speakers,
                        5 youth panelists and an organizing team of 30+ youth. With the incredible workshops, booth displays, 
                        keynotes and panel discussion that we had, we were able to dive into Augmented & Virtual Reality, 
                        Cellular Biology & Genetics, Space Exploration & Space Mining, AI & Deep Learning, Robotics, Entrepreneurship, 
                        Finding Your Way As Youth and more! </p>

                        <br>
                        <p>In May, Innovire also celebrated our 5 year anniversary - and we were all incredibly proud to have reached that milestone!
                          5 years ago when we started, none of us imagined that we would be where we are today and we could not have done it 
                          without all the help and support we've gotten. </p>
                        
                        <p> As Innovire has grown over the years - with various initiatives, campaigns and programs - we have been able to connect with, 
                          impact and inspire 1500+ youth. The last 5 years have been full of highs and lows - experiencing mixtures of success, doubt 
                          and failures as the world changed rapidly around us and as the team grew older and bigger. Our team is as motivated as ever, 
                          as we continue to expand, fulfill new goals and create innovative, cost-effective opportunities for youth to innovate. 
                          The last year was rewarding as we were able to finally return in-person regularly for events, while still finding the 
                          right instances to connect virtually. We had a blast while meeting people from our community and conducting our events in person! </p>
                        
                        <p> Celebrating our 5 year anniversary, we want to thank everyone within the community for all your continued support. 
                          It's been fulfilling to see the community grow and develop over the years - and to see the incredible passion and 
                          talent within it. Our community is the best in the world - made up of youth with a wide range of talent, passions 
                          and aspirations and we hope to continue to inspire all of you to innovate solutions to problems faced by our world.
                          We would also be nowhere without our mentors and sponsors, so a major shoutout to them for all their guidance, 
                          patience and support - without them we would not be able to bring all the amazing opportunities and experiences to our audience! </p>

                        <p> Celebrating 5 years also means a time of change. For the first time we will be having members of the team graduating
                          Grade 12 and moving on to university (including us!) - meaning big changes within our team and leadership. As the graduating 
                          members take a step back, the younger ones will be stepping up into new roles, and we're excited for all that means! 
                          (More information on this is coming soon...) </p>

                        <p> As Innovire rounds off its 5th year and moves towards its 6th, we reflect on all that we have accomplished already
                          with pride and gratitude and look ahead with determination - inspired to continue working towards fulfilling our vision. 
                          Having reached the 5 year milestone, we're excited to look ahead towards our 10th and how much we can grow and improve in 
                          the next few years! </p>

                      <p>Where Innovation Meets Inspiration. </p>
                            
                      <p>Best wishes, </p>
                            
                      <p>Abdullah Sabole, Khushi Patel & Elle Kerr</p>
